# Farmers Market Database
A Ruby on Rails web application built by @alyssahursh and @brianaeng. Our first Rails application.

## Technologies
* Primary language: Ruby 2.3.1
* Framework: Rails 4.7.2
* Database seeding from CSV
* HTML/CSS

## Successes
* We worked very well together, splitting up front-end and back-end work to avoid merge conflicts and maintain project velocity.
* We created a mock login feature, redirecting to a "logged in" view from certain ingresses (we hadn't yet learned user authentication).
* The layout and design turned out quite well (especially given that this was our second project with a front-end).
